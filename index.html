                VUE
                <p>
                  Vue’s accolades include a gradual learning curve (making it
                  accessible to new JavaScript developers), an HTML-based syntax
                  that allows users to write pages in standard HTML format
                  (instead of requiring the user to learn a framework-specific
                  language), and the option to apply as much or as little of the
                  JavaScript framework to your project as you want.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                React
                <p>
                  Like Vue, React is designed for incremental implementation
                  (meaning it’s another tool that lets you use it as little or
                  as much as you need), and it also comes with a reputation
                  having a supportive developer community.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                Angular
                <p>
                  Angular has a somewhat steeper learning curve than frameworks
                  like Vue (Angular uses a framework-specific JS variant
                  language called TypeScript, which you’ll also have to get
                  familiar with if you want to learn Angular), but as you can
                  see from the job listings, its a preferred standard for many
                  employers.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The takeaway? JavaScript frameworks are a powerful tool for
                  saving time and structuring your JavaScript code. While the
                  specific JavaScript framework you use will vary based on
                  project requirements and employer preferences, a solid
                  foundation in the JavaScript language will make it easy for
                  you to pick up framework skills when the need arises.
